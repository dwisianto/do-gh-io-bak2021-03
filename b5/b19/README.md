### Passage-based Document Retrieval 


a document can be deemed relevant to a
query even if it contains a very short passage of text with pertinent information
This fact has motivated work on passage-based document retrieval:  
document ranking methods that induce information from the document’s passages.
However, the main source of passage-based information utilized was passage-query similarities.  
We address the challenge of utilizing richer sources of passage-based information to improve document retrieval effectiveness.  
Specifically,  we devise a suite of learning-to-rank-based document retrieval methods 
that utilize a highly effective ranking of passages produced in response to the query; 
passage ranking is also induced using a learning-to-rank approach.  
Empirical evaluation attests to the clear merits of our methods with respect to strong baselines.
