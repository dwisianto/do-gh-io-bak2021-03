## ThreadLocal

_August 17, 2019_

__java.lang.ThreadLocal__ is a useful tool to determine whether a Java application  is thread-safe or not.

<!--
 is used to declare Java objects in Thread scope.
using ThreadLocal to store a per-thread-singleton or per-thread context information has a valuable information included – by using a ThreadLocal, 
it’s clear that the object stored in the ThreadLocal is not shared between threads, 
 

ThreadLocal variables are used in Java to bind a variable to the current Thread – each thread will have its own, independend instance of that variable. 
These kind of variables are normally used to hold status information like the user, that are needed in the entire application and you don’t want to have in every method signature.

The lifecyle of ThreadLocal variables is directly interconnected to the lifecyle of its corespondig thread. If the thread is terminated and collected by the Garbage Collector, its coresponding ThreadLocal variables will also be good candidates for Garbage Collcetion.
