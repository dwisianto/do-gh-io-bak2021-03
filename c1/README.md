# Lisbon Summer School 2011 

- During the morning there will be lectures focusing on the main areas of ML and their application to NLP. These areas include but are not restricted to: Classification, Structured Prediction (sequences, trees, graphs), Parsing, Semi-Supervised Learning, and their applications to practical language processing on the Web.
- For each topic introduced in the morning there will be a practical session in the afternoon, where students will have the opportunity to test the concepts in practice.
    - The practical sessions will consist in implementation exercises (using Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib) of the methods learned during the morning, testing them on real examples.
- At the end of the afternoon there will be special talks of concrete applications of the these techniques being currently used in production.
