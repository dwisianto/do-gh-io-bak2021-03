## Design Pattern


### Template Patterns
Template pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows part of an algorithm to vary independent of the rest of the algorithm. 
In other words, the bulk of the algorithm logic is defined in a base class (could be abstract) and the part that can change is defined in a derived class. 
Each derived class can then define its own logic for the changing part. 
Use the template pattern when you have multiple algorithms that have mostly common logic but have minor differences. 
The minor differences are extracted out of the base class and into its own derived class.

To illustrate the template pattern we use the example of a car manufacturing algorithm.

## Why use it?

When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an "out of
memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.
