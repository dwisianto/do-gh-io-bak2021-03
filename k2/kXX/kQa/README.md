# Coding Interview University

> I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer,
> but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, [I got hired
> as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon](https://startupnextdoor.com/ive-been-acquired-by-amazon/?src=ciu)!
> You probably won't have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
>
> The items listed here will prepare you well for an interview at just about any software company,
> including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google or Microsoft.
>
> *Best of luck to you!*
