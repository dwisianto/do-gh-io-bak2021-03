- Wikipedia: Watson (computer). This URL will take you to a Wikipedia page about IBM Watson.  Specifically, this page provides additional information about Watson on Jeopardy!



- IBM: The code of ethics for AI and chatbots that every brand should follow. Ethics should be a core consideration of any action taken by a business. With chatbots still in a stage of relative infancy, the discovery of new ethical issues is likely to continue. Businesses should continue to learn from these emerging cases and build their guiding principles and ethical standards.  This URL will open an IBM blog discussing this topic.

- Wikipedia: Computing Machinery and Intelligence. This URL will take you to a Wikipedia page discussing "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", a seminal paper written by Alan Turing on the topic of artificial intelligence. The paper, published in 1950 in Mind, was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public.
